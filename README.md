### Exploring Bikeshare Data With Python and Pandas


### Description
In the course of completing my studies for a Udacity Nanodegree in Programming for Data Science, I was required to complete a project using Python and the data analysis library Pandas that examined historical bikeshare data from Chicago, NYC, and Washington.

Various functionality of the Python script was required by the project rubric and included data analysis tasks such as calculating travel times between bikeshare stops, reading CSV data files into Pandas dataframes, and displaying raw data output to the user upon request.

### Files used
The main Python script is `bikeshare.py`. Three CSV data files are also included for use by the Python script.

### Credits
I'm hugely thankful to the friends I made in various programming-related Discord communities. As I'm fairly new to the programming world, I got very stuck a few times, and these kind dev folk helped me see my follies and understand proper solutions.
